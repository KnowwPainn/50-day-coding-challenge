    <h1>Ethan Haynes</h1>
    <p>My name is Ethan. Some things about me is that I love to read books, take care of my plants, and cook and bake. I am also a big fan of watching anime and exploring new things in the world.
        Currently I am a Fullstack Software Engineer and Tech Lead at my job. I have always loved programming and technology in general because its like magic to me. With my favorite tv series genre being fantasy it 
        was on natural for me to fall in love with coding.
